# nqueens
The nqueens problem idea is that we need to place N queens on a N x N board in a way that none of them are attaching each other. This project considers the cases of N=4, N=8 and N=16.
The code in this project attempts to solve the nqueens puzzle using several different methods and compares their accuracy and efficiency with number of rounds it takes to solve, as well as the time it takes to solve it. The methods used are the hill climbing algorithm, hill climbing algorithm with random restart, simulated annealing and local beam search.

Starter code and additional help was provided by Professor Md Reza.
The project was created with three classmates : Lindsay Chappell, Rachel Current and Page Hardy in May 2023.
